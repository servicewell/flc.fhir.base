Welcome to the Implementation Guide for **FHIR Liquid Conversion (FLC)**, a powerful, template-driven approach to converting data into FHIR using Liquid templates enriched with terminology mappings. This guide is maintained by **Service Well AB**, the owner and maintainer of this FLC framework and associated IG tooling.

## 🔍 What is FLC?

FHIR Liquid Conversion (FLC) is a structured, opinionated way of managing input-to-FHIR transformations using Liquid templates and standard FHIR IG tooling. It builds on the open source project [FHIR Converter](https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter) but introduces several key improvements:

## 🔧 About This Implementationguide

This Implementation Guide adds profiles and extensions to be able to package FLC int an Implementation Guide.

Rather than creating a separate transformation project structure around the engine, our goal is to **enable direct use of FLC within an IG**. All mapping resources – including FSH definitions and transformation templates – are authored and maintained inside the IG itself, making the conversion logic version-controlled and portable.

---

## ✨ Key Enhancements

We have introduced the following key improvements to support our use cases:

- **Native XML support** in the engine, allowing input formats common in healthcare (e.g., KITH messages, CDA) to be handled without preprocessing.
- **FSH mapping integration**, enabling transformation logic to be expressed directly in FSH artifacts like StructureMaps, ConceptMaps, and CodeSystems.
- **Terminology service integration**, with full support for FHIR `$translate`, `$expand`, and `$validate-code` operations at runtime – powered by a connected FHIR Terminology Server.
- **No external project scaffolding required**: The engine can be invoked directly from within the IG, simplifying the developer experience and aligning with FHIR's publication tooling.

## 🤝 Philosophy and Vision

Our aim is not to replace or compete with FHIR-Converter approach, but to **build on their open idea** in a way that aligns with our needs:

- **IG-native workflows**: We believe mappings should live and evolve inside the IG that owns them – just like profiles do.
- **Federated mappings**: The engine and templates are designed to reference **external Liquid templates and ConceptMaps**, allowing reuse across FLC-based IGs. (ToDo)
- **Terminology-first**

FLC enables both **human-readable** and **machine-executable** transformations, directly linked to terminology servers and structured with official FHIR packaging mechanisms.

## 📁 Folder Structure Overview

Recomended IG structure:

```bash
input/
├── fsh/                  # Standard FSH files defining models, mappings, and terminology used in the transformation
│   ├── logicalmodels/    # Logical models representing source and target structures
│   │   ├──source/        # Sourcemodels
│   ├── logicalmaps/      # ConceptMaps used exclusively for logical (structural) mapping, not code translation
│   ├── conceptmaps/      # ConceptMaps referenced by the mapping logic. These may be defined locally or resolved dynamically via a FHIR Terminology Server.
│   ├── valuesets/        # ValueSets used during transformation; may be embedded or externally referenced via terminology service.
│   ├── codesystems/      # CodeSystems used for validation or mapping, either defined in the IG or fetched at runtime.
│   ├── structuremaps/    # FLC-specific StructureMap resources defining what to map and which Liquid template to use
│   ├── examples/         # Generated mapping result examples in valid FHIR (result from liquid converter converts to FSH)
├── flc/
│   ├── templates/        # Liquid templates that perform the actual transformation logic
│   ├── sampledata/       # Sample data files used for testing and demonstration of mappingss
flc-config.yaml           # Configuration file specifying sources, targets, templates, and transformation behavior

## Dependencies

If your FLC templates use external terminology (e.g. EU Laboratory standards), make sure to declare these as dependencies in your `sushi-config.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  hl7.fhir.eu.ips: 0.1.0
```

All ConceptMaps referenced in FLC must be available in your local FHIR terminology service.

## Components Explained

- `StructureMap` (with profile `LiquidStructureMap`) is used to declare:
  - Source structure (e.g., `FLCSourcePatient`)
  - Target structure (e.g., `Patient`)
  - Linked Liquid template file (e.g., `ExamplePatient.liquid`)
  - Terminology packages (ToDo)

- `ConceptMap` links external/local source codes to FHIR target values
- `Liquid` templates transform parsed input → FHIR JSON using placeholders
